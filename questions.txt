Why do some rows have more than one uniprot accession?
    Should they be split into more than one row, or left as one?

    Consider it to be zero, or absent?

Is palbo normalisation the same as Nocodozole normalisation?
    Actually presumably it should be normalised by the first stage, as that's what Palbo is.
