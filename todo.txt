TODO - Look up the gene names and protein names for that uniprot accession
WON'T DO - Calculate confidence - is included in ICR database but not ours AFAIK
LATER - Get protein annotations


TODO does the python version have a bug?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75477927/scipys-fishers-exact-p-value-differs-from-exact-formula


NEXT - write tests for all functions


# TODO - protein_oscillation_abundances residuals average is wrong. 
#   Also R_squared_average, curve_fold_change and others.
#   It's because calculate_metrics isn't working. It requires a lot of study.
# TODO - is the above still true? They're OK for Q93075

# TODO - position_abundances imputed values are slightly too high.
#   Due to empty values perhaps?

# TODO - rename protein_phospho_result to combined_result or somesuch
# TODO - make _proteo iterate by protein and not prebuild the dict
# TODO - ICR doesn't have phospho_regression (??). It's there for Q93075 though...
# TODO - get rid of 'abundance_average' as an output field name
# TODO - most of the warnings are from _calculate_metrics


Move all fisher calculations to one function, to save having multiple installs?
Make batch populate a new field, so it can be run independently?
Create a JSON schema for the results
min-max and imputed values are calculated differently between protein and phospho
Add 'peptide_abundances' to phospho output?
Count number of imputed data points
Change things to defaultdicts?
In ICR of the imputed protein values are flagged "experimental", none are imputed.
    Strip out imputation code? Check phospho with ICR?
Find out which functions aren't actually needed
Move functions out of command file and into a lib dir
process/management/commands/process.py:44: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
    Higher level of mypy checking required? Check work.
Add uniqueness constraints to models
Add Final to various variables
Write tests for with_bugs?
Round the various stats
I have no idea what PepTools_annotations is about
    or protein-phospho-correlation
    or phosho-protein-cfc_ratio


### Later

q value similar but not quite the same
Validate all the various statistical calculations
Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
