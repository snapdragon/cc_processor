Why are there so many missing values? Should they be considered zero or none?
    Should they be imputed? Would that work with so little data? What is imputation for?
    Is the method of imputing data what we want? Linear imputation.

What should phosphosite be for SL?
Is Precursor.Id the correct field to use for identifying a mod? What field for phosphosite?

min-max and impute values are calculated differently in proteo and phosho. And position_abundances?
    Which is correct?
    Proteo uses calclog2RelativeAbundance
    Phospho uses firstLevelNormalisationPhospho

The ICR data has various values for 'confidence'. What about us?

How does kinase prediction work?

What proportion of the paper should be about the cell cycle in general, and what to the experiment?

What to do about all the bugs? Mention them in the paper?
    Should I leave in all the code for ICR, such as for generating correct results?

Bugs:

Mean
Median
Variation in imputed and min-max between protein and phospho
The linear imputation wraps round at the upper end
Various values not calculated when they could be do to try-except structure
