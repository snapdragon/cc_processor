### Steps

DONE - Iterate through the rows of data_points, getting uniprot accession for each row
    Sort of done. What about the lines with multiple accessions number?
DONE AND CHECKED - calculate the medians for each column (why?) - AFFECTED BY ICR BUG
TODO - Look up the gene names and protein names for that uniprot accession
TODO - Populate time_course_proteome with some default values for each uniprot accession
DONE BY DEFAULT - Convert the abundances for the dict for the uniprot accession, which are identified
    by column name, to times instead of column names
DONE AND CHECKED - Get the means of the abundances, as far as possible - AFFECTED BY ICR BUG
DONE AND CHECKED - Do first level normalisation, which are by median - AFFECTED BY ICR BUG
DONE AND CHECKED - Calculate the averages of the normalised abundances - AFFECTED BY ICR BUG
DONE AND CHECKED - Normalise all abundances to Palbo and calculate log2 of them
DONE AND CHECKED - Calculate the averages of the palbo log 2 normalised
DONE AND CHECKED - Subtract log2 mean for each rep, and normalise
DONE AND CHECKED - Second level normalised data
DONE AND CHECKED - Calculate min-max for each rep, and normalise
DONE AND CHECKED - Calculate 0-max for each rep, and normalise
DONE AND CHECKED - Calculate imputed values
DONE AND CHECKED - Calculate stats
Calculate ANOVA
Calculate confidence
Create data frame TODO - why?
Get ANOVA q values
Don't get Fisher G values yet
    TODO does the python version have a bug?

LATER - Get protein annotations
Change main loop to be by protein


NEXT - get steps for phospho


Look up the values from the paper for a relevant protein to see if it matches buggy output
Write a test for _calculate_first_level_normalisation
Write a test for _calculate_arrest_log2_normalisation
Write a test for _calculate_relative_log2_normalisation
Write tests for all the functions
process/management/commands/process.py:44: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
    Higher level of mypy checking required? Check work.
Add uniqueness constraints to models
Add Final to various variables
Write tests for with_bugs?
Round the various stats


### Later

Validate all the various statistical calculations
    median, mean
Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
Update python version?
