### Steps

DONE - Iterate through the rows of data_points, getting uniprot accession for each row
    Sort of done. What about the lines with multiple accessions number?
DONE AND CHECKED - calculate the medians for each column (why?) - AFFECTED BY ICR BUG
TODO - Look up the gene names and protein names for that uniprot accession
TODO - Populate time_course_proteome with some default values for each uniprot accession
NOT NEEDED - Convert the abundances for the dict for the uniprot accession, which are identified
    by column name, to times instead of column names
DONE AND CHECKED - Get the means of the renamed abundances, as far as possible - AFFECTED BY ICR BUG
DONE - Do first level normalisation, which are by median - AFFECTED BY ICR BUG
DONE- Calculate the averages of the normalised renamed abundances
Normalise all abundances to Palbo and calculate log2 of them
Subtract log2 mean for each rep, and normalise
Calculate min-max for each rep, and normalise
Calculate 0-max for each rep, and normalise
Calculate imputed values TODO - what?
Calculate stats
Calculate ANOVA
Calculate confidence
Create data frame TODO - why?
Get ANOVA q values
Don't get Fisher G values yet
    TODO does the python version have a bug?

Get protein annotations



Write a test for _calculate_first_level_normalisation
Add uniqueness constraints to models
Study all pytest marks
Write tests for with_bugs?


### Later

Validate all the various statistical calculations
    median, mean
Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
Update python version?
