WON'T DO - Calculate confidence - is included in ICR database but not ours AFAIK


TODO does the python version have a bug?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75477927/scipys-fishers-exact-p-value-differs-from-exact-formula


NEXT - write tests for all functions


# TODO - position_abundances imputed values are slightly too high.
#   Due to empty values perhaps?

# TODO - make _proteo iterate by protein and not prebuild the dict
# TODO - get rid of 'abundance_average' as an output field name
# TODO - most of the warnings are from _calculate_metrics



Fix NaN values in _add_protein_oscillations
Get generate_kinase_predictions working with SL
    How does generate_kinase_predictions even work? Is it appropriate for the data we have?

Find a way to make the nested directory structure of the json less complicated.
    Maybe add another DB table or two, with a name for the type of data and a replicate field?
    And another table for metrics?

Study all the SL phospho errors
Find a way to assess how sparse the data sets are
Move all fisher calculations to one function, to save having multiple installs?
Make batch populate a new field, so it can be run independently?
Create a JSON schema for the results
min-max and imputed values are calculated differently between protein and phospho in ICR
    Which way is the correct way?
Add 'peptide_abundances' to phospho output?
Count number of imputed data points
Change things to defaultdicts?
RunResult probably isn't needed, the results could be put in Protein and Phospho
When looking up gene names, try all the uniprot accessions for the protein.
    They all refer to the same protein.
In ICR of the imputed protein values are flagged "experimental", none are imputed.
    Strip out imputation code? Check phospho with ICR?
Find out which functions aren't actually needed
Move functions out of command file and into a lib dir
process/management/commands/process.py:44: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
    Higher level of mypy checking required? Check work.
Check uniqueness constraints for models
Add Final to various variables
I have no idea what PepTools_annotations is about
    or protein-phospho-correlation
    or phosho-protein-cfc_ratio


### Later

Validate all the various statistical calculations
Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
