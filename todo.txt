position_abundances imputed values are slightly too high.
    Due to empty values perhaps?

most of the warnings are from _calculate_metrics SL



Check all constraints



Lots of protein q value matches like this:
ANOVA metrics match for abundances normalised log2_mean for Q13505 for q_value reading 0.6462170052202973 vs 0.7023935403984614

Add code to return a message if no flags are supplied
Study all the SL phospho errors
_add_protein_annotations might not be needed.
_get_kinase_predictions should be excluded unless I can
    figure out what it does and if it's needed.



Compare proteins metrics for Q09666 has not very good q-value:
ANOVA metrics match for abundances normalised log2_mean for Q09666 for q_value reading 0.6470752162303733 vs 0.7033535395638385


Add tests for
    _calculate_protein_q_and_fisher_g
    _calculate_phospho_q_and_fisher_g
    _add_oscillations

Add _add_phospho_regression?


All the zeros for SL make log2 impossible to calculate. Should the values be set to None or
    missed out?

Changing _generate_xs_ys to use whichever replicate has more values might
    improve the results
If a cell has a value for phospho but not for protein, something is wrong
Change SL import_protein and import_phospho to be zero, not nothing
Replace the linear imputation with a better version and with-bugs for the old
Wrap all code that has the not i % 1000 in a function then wrap that in a decorator?
Add admin app
Go through the code and make it work with no records created for empty values
    in import_protein and import_phospho
Move fetching of gene_name and protein_name to import_protein, or get rid of them?
Find a way to assess how sparse the data sets are
min-max and imputed values are calculated differently between protein and phospho in ICR
    Which way is the correct way?
Add 'peptide_abundances' to phospho output?
When looking up gene names, try all the uniprot accessions for the protein.
    They all refer to the same protein.
In ICR of the imputed protein values are flagged "experimental", none are imputed.
    Strip out imputation code? Check phospho with ICR?
    SL will have no imputed values (I guess) as it will have no Nones.
Find out which functions aren't actually needed
Move functions out of command file and into a lib dir
process/management/commands/process.py:44: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
    Higher level of mypy checking required? Check work.


### Later

Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
