### Steps

DONE - Iterate through the rows of data_points, getting uniprot accession for each row
    Sort of done. What about the lines with multiple accessions number?
TODO - Look up the gene names and protein names for that uniprot accession
TODO - Populate time_course_proteome with some default values for each uniprot accession
DONE BY DEFAULT - Convert the abundances for the dict for the uniprot accession, which are identified
    by column name, to times instead of column names
WON'T DO - Calculate confidence - is included in ICR database but not ours AFAIK
LATER - Get protein annotations


Get ANOVA q values
The fisher G values are wildly different. Find out why.
Don't get Fisher G values yet
    TODO does the python version have a bug?

NEXT - write tests for all functions


min-max and imputed values are calculated differently between protein and phospho
Add 'peptide_abundances' to phospho output?
Count number of imputed data points
Change things to defaultdicts?
ICR ANOVA q-value "q value" 0.6470752162303733, here 0.6492445296947472. Does it matter?
In ICR of the imputed protein values are flagged "experimental", none are imputed.
    Strip out imputation code? Check phospho with ICR?
Interrogate jsonb in DB for various things, e.g. differences between ICR and SL
Find out which functions aren't actually needed
Move functions out of command file
process/management/commands/process.py:44: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
    Higher level of mypy checking required? Check work.
Add uniqueness constraints to models
Add Final to various variables
Write tests for with_bugs?
Round the various stats


### Later

Validate all the various statistical calculations
    median, mean
Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
Update python version?
