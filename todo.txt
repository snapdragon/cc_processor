### Steps

TODO - Look up the gene names and protein names for that uniprot accession
WON'T DO - Calculate confidence - is included in ICR database but not ours AFAIK
LATER - Get protein annotations


The fisher G values are wildly different. Find out why.
Don't get Fisher G values yet
    TODO does the python version have a bug?
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75477927/scipys-fishers-exact-p-value-differs-from-exact-formula


NEXT - write tests for all functions


Move r code to a separate script and communicate with it?
Make batch populate a new field, so it can be run independently
Create a JSON schema for the results
Fix all the _calculate_metrics errors
min-max and imputed values are calculated differently between protein and phospho
Add 'peptide_abundances' to phospho output?
Count number of imputed data points
What about protein_info? It looks important.
Change things to defaultdicts?
In ICR of the imputed protein values are flagged "experimental", none are imputed.
    Strip out imputation code? Check phospho with ICR?
Find out which functions aren't actually needed
Move functions out of command file and into a lib dir
process/management/commands/process.py:44: note: By default the bodies of untyped functions are not checked, consider using --check-untyped-defs  [annotation-unchecked]
    Higher level of mypy checking required? Check work.
Add uniqueness constraints to models
Add Final to various variables
Write tests for with_bugs?
Round the various stats
I have no idea what PepTools_annotations is about
    or protein-phospho-correlation
    or phosho-protein-cfc_ratio


### Later

q value similar but not quite the same
Validate all the various statistical calculations
Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
