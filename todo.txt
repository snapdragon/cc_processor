### Steps

DONE - Iterate through the rows of data_points, getting uniprot accession for each row
DONE - calculate the medians for each column (why?)
TODO - Look up the gene names and protein names for that uniprot accession
TODO - Populate time_course_proteome with some default values for each uniprot accession
NOT NEEDED - Convert the abundances for the dict for the uniprot accession, which are identified
    by column name, to times instead of column names
DONE - Get the averages of the renamed abundances, as far as possible
Do first level normalisation, which are by median
Calculate the averages of the normalised renamed abundances
Normalise all abundances to Palbo and calculate log2 of them
Subtract log2 mean for each rep, and normalise
Calculate min-max for each rep, and normalise
Calculate 0-max for each rep, and normalise
Calculate imputed values TODO - what?
Calculate stats
Calculate ANOVA
Calculate confidence
Create data frame TODO - why?
Get ANOVA q values
Don't get Fisher G values yet
    TODO does the python version have a bug?
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75477927/scipys-fishers-exact-p-value-differs-from-exact-formula
Get protein annotations



Set all missing abundances to None, not NaN?
Write tests for _all_replicates and for medians calculation


### Later

Change dockerfile to not have to run the env after start
The docker config for the cc_processor keeps the shell alive, but it then does nothing.
    How to improve this?
Update python version?
