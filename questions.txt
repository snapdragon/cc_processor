Is palbo normalisation the same as Nocodozole normalisation?
    Actually presumably it should be normalised by the first stage, as that's what Palbo is.

Is the method of imputing data what we want? Linear imputation between nearest timepoints I believe.

The ICR data has various values for 'confidence'. What about us?

min-max and impute values are calculated differently in proteo and phosho. And position_abundances?
    Which is correct?
    Proteo uses calclog2RelativeAbundance
    Phospho uses firstLevelNormalisationPhospho

Is there some equivalent of ICR's cell_cycle_mitotic_exit_analyser?

Is Precursor.Id the correct field to use for identifying a mod? What field for phosphosite?

What should phosphosite be for SL?

Am I using the correct sheets?
    What's the difference between the two Peptides 1% FDR (pr_matrix) pages?
    The first has more rows.
