Is palbo normalisation the same as Nocodozole normalisation?
    Actually presumably it should be normalised by the first stage, as that's what Palbo is.

Is the method of imputing data what we want? Linear imputation between nearest timepoints I believe.

The ICR data has various values for 'confidence'. What about us?

min-max and impute values are calculated differently in proteo and phosho. And position_abundances?
    Which is correct?
    Proteo uses calclog2RelativeAbundance
    Phospho uses firstLevelNormalisationPhospho
